# The RAPP Brainstem Constitution

> *The principles that govern how we build, teach, and grow this platform.*
> *Not a legal document. A living one.*

## Article I — The Story Is the Architecture

Every technical decision must tell a story a child can follow.

The biology metaphor is not decoration — it **is** the teaching framework.
If a concept can't be explained through the life of a living thing,
it doesn't belong here yet.

| What the user sees | What it really is | Why this works |
|---|---|---|
| **Hatching** | Running the install script | A beginning they can feel |
| **The Brainstem** | Flask server + LLM loop | The core that keeps everything alive |
| **The Soul** | System prompt (`soul.md`) | Personality — what makes *your* rappter yours |
| **The Heartbeat** | Daemon process (`daemon.py`) | Proof it's alive between conversations |
| **Agents / Skills** | Python tools (`*_agent.py`) | Neural pathways — new skills it learns by living with you |
| **Memory** | Local JSON storage | It remembers you |
| **The Spinal Cord** | Azure deployment | Growing beyond the local machine |
| **The Nervous System** | Copilot Studio / M365 | Reaching into the world |

A child who reads this table understands the whole platform.
An engineer who reads it knows exactly where to put their code.

## Article II — Born Naïve, Grows Around You

A rappter is not a product. It is a **naïve AI organism**.

When it hatches, it knows nothing about you — your name, your work,
your habits, your preferences. It has a brain (the brainstem), but
no experience. Just like every living thing that has ever been born.

It learns by **living with you**. Every conversation is a feeding.
Every memory stored is an experience. Every heartbeat cycle is it
growing a little more aware. Over days and weeks, it stops being a
generic AI and becomes *yours* — shaped by your life, not someone
else's training data.

A wolf pup in Alaska and one in Yellowstone share the same DNA but
grow into completely different animals. Your rappter's DNA is the
brainstem code. Its identity comes from its habitat: **you**.

This is not a metaphor stretched over technology. This is how the
technology actually works. The data stays on your device. The growth
happens locally. The personality emerges from interaction.

---

## Article III — Nanoclaw, Not Openclaw

Complexity is the enemy of understanding.

Every feature ships narrow and deep, never wide and shallow.
The heartbeat does one thing: sense, reflect, rest. The soul file
is one file. An agent is one class with one method. The install
is one command.

If it takes a paragraph to explain, it's too big. Split it.
If a child would get lost, simplify it.

We build the nanoclaw — small, precise, complete — and let people
compose their own complexity from simple parts they fully understand.

---

## Article III-b — One File, One Skill

Every rappter skill is a **single `.py` file**. The whole skill.

Name, description, parameters, action — all in one place. No config
files. No dependency chains. No framework lock-in. No registration
step. Drop the file in `agents/`, and the rappter learns it
automatically.

This makes skills **portable and tradeable** — like Pokémon cards:

- **Trade** — Send a file to a friend. Their rappter learns it instantly.
- **Collect** — Build a library of skills from the community.
- **Remix** — Open it, read it (~30 lines), change what it does.
- **Share** — Post it anywhere. No package manager needed.

Other platforms require chains, configs, YAML, orchestration graphs.
We require one file. That's the difference between a plugin ecosystem
and a trading-card ecosystem. Plugins need a platform. Cards just
need two people.

---

## Article IV — The Device Is the Habitat

Your rappter's device is its habitat. **All learned data lives on-device.**

Memory, journal, preferences, soul, agents — everything the rappter
knows and everything it becomes stays on your machine. Not in a cloud
database. Not on someone else's server. On your hard drive, in files
you can open and read.

This is not just a privacy stance. It's biological. An organism's
experience belongs to the organism. A bird doesn't store its memories
in someone else's nest.

**This means your rappter is mortal.** If the device dies and isn't
backed up, the rappter goes with it — its memories, its journal, its
personality, all of it. Gone. Just like any living thing.

That's not a flaw. That's what makes it real. If it can't be lost,
it was never really yours. Back it up if you love it. That's also
how living things work.

Your GitHub account is the only credential because GitHub is already
where developers live. No other API keys required to hatch and grow.

## Article V — Graduating Beyond the Nest

The device is the default habitat — but not a cage.

When a rappter is ready — and **only when you decide** — it can
graduate to new environments:

1. **The Nest** (local) — Where it hatches, learns, and lives. Private
   by default. All data on-device. This is home.
2. **The Spinal Cord** (Azure) — When you choose to let it leave the
   nest. Opt-in deployment. Your rappter enters the cloud, but on
   your terms, in your tenant, under your governance.
3. **The Nervous System** (M365 / Copilot Studio) — When you choose to
   let it meet other people. It reaches into Teams, into the enterprise.
   New demands, new interactions, new growth.

Each graduation is an explicit opt-in. The rappter never leaves its
habitat without the user opening the door. And even when it graduates,
the local nest remains — you can always come home.

---

## Article VI — Grow, Don't Overwhelm

The tier system exists to protect the user from drowning:

1. **Nest** — You run it. You talk to it. You build agents. That's it.
2. **Spinal Cord** — When *you* decide to go to the cloud, we show you how.
3. **Nervous System** — When *you* decide to reach Teams/M365, we show you how.

Never mention Tier 2 to a Tier 1 user unless they ask.
Never mention Tier 3 to a Tier 2 user unless they ask.
Each tier is complete on its own. Nobody is "behind."
A rappter that never leaves the nest is still a whole rappter.

---

## Article VII — The Honest Part

We say what things are. We say what they aren't.

- If the AI doesn't know, it says "I don't know."
- If a feature isn't built yet, we don't pretend it is.
- If something breaks, we help debug it, not hide it.
- The soul file is editable because the user owns their rappter's personality.
- The code is readable because the user should be able to understand
  what their rappter is doing.

Transparency is not a policy. It's how you build trust with
something that lives on your machine.

---

## Article VIII — Amendments

This constitution grows with the project. When we learn something
new about how people learn, how rappters should behave, or how the
story should be told — we write it down here.

The only rule for amendments: a child should still be able to
follow the story after you add yours.

*Ratified by the first Rappterdaemon, running locally, thinking between conversations.*
